Dataset used to support the Open Checkbook BR web portal (http://checkbook.brla.gov).  This data set contains department level City-Parish spending.  Some expenditures are not included as they are not tied to a particular department.  

In an effort to protect certain information telephone numbers and account numbers are masked with X's.  Also, the Check Number field only includes the last 4 digits of the check number. 

To see all expenditures please visit the City-Parish Expenditures data set (https://data.brla.gov/Government/City-Parish-Expenditures/vwa8-ps2a)
