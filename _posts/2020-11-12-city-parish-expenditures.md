This expenditures dataset includes a listing and description of  City-Parish department-level spending.  Data is captured from January 1, 2018 to present as any data prior to this date resides in multiple disparate systems in various formats, which were subsequently streamlined through the implementation of the City-Parish's enterprise resource planning system financial module in late 2017.

In an effort to protect certain information telephone numbers and account numbers are masked with X's.  Also, the Check Number field only includes the last 4 digits of the check number.
