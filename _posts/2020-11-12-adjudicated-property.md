In the event that your taxes are not paid by a certain date, the Sheriff's Office will advertise your property for sale to the general public to collect the unpaid taxes.  On the advertised date, the property will be subjected to a tax sale.  If no one buys the property at the tax sale, the property will then be adjudicated to the Parish of East Baton Rouge in compliance with the laws of the State of Louisiana.  The records in this dataset reflect the most current adjudicated property listing.
