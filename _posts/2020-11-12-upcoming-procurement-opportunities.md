This dataset contains upcoming purchasing and contracting opportunities which are anticipated to be advertised within this fiscal year. This listing is being provided prior to the procurementâ€™s issuance in order to provide an opportunity for the vendor community to plan ahead as well as network and to identify potentially viable SBE/MBE/WBE/SDVE participation solutions either by means of direct participation or through partnering arrangements.

The City of Baton Rouge, Parish of East Baton Rouge anticipates, but does not guarantee, the following schedule, including the number of awards, and reserves the right to change, eliminate or add opportunities as needed.
