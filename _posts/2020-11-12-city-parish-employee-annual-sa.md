City-Parish employees' annual salaries and other payroll related information. Information is calculated after the last payroll is run for the year specified.  Some fields, such as job title and department, are accurate as of the time the data was captured for Open Data BR.  For example, if an employee worked for three departments throughout the year, only the department they worked for at the time we collected the data will be shown. 

***In November of 2018, the City-Parish switched to a new payroll system.  This data contains employee information from 2018 onward.  For prior year data, please see the Legacy City-Parish Employee Annual Salaries https://data.brla.gov/Government/Legacy-City-Parish-Employee-Annual-Salaries/g5c2-myyj
