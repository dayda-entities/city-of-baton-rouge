***THIS DATASET IS NO LONGER UPDATED***
In November 2018, the City-Parish switched to a new payroll system.   We are in the final stages of adding employee data from the new system into Open Data BR.  This data can be used to see employees as of the last day in the former payroll system. 

City-Parish employees, both active and inactive, that exist in the City-Parish Payroll System.
