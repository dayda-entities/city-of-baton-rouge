This dataset displays all facilities and properties operated by the East Baton Rouge Parish Recreation and Park Commission (BREC).  This includes all parks, public golf courses, community centers, and special purpose recreational facilities (such as the Baton Rouge Zoo).

The amenity columns (Tennis Courts, Fishing Lakes, etc)  show how many of that amenity exist at each park.
